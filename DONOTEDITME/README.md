# Base Folder
This folder contains all scripts and assets for the Plug n' Play base. In general you should NOT be touching anything in this folder, and instead you should be copying or extending functionality that is defined in this folder. Doing so will make it easier for us to combine all of the submissions into one final project at the end of the jam.
