In order for the hurtbox to detect something as dangerous it must be on the Enemy, EnemyProjectile, or Hazard collision layer. Other than that this is just a fancy Area2D node that binds to the player class's default hurt method. Even if you're customizing player behavior I encourage you to use this custom scene.
