## This is a basic default PlayerHitbox component designed to automatically work
## with the basic player class. When a hurtbox on the Enemy, EnemyProjectile, or Hazard
## layers enters this hitbox, the player damage function is called with the damage
## dealer's information. In order to get this to work as universally as possible, 
## the hitbox simply checks if the opposing hurtbox has a "get_source_damage()" method.

## This is the default hitbox detection behavior. It makes the assumption that the opposing hurtbox
## is a component/child of the object responsible for dealing damage to the player. It checks if that
## object has a get_source_damage() method and applies that damage to the player accordingly.
